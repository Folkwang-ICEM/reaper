Note that as of 2.7.24 the channel order is with one exception as proposed by
Michael (Atmos-approx.) and as used in ICEM's decoder mappings but the
Beschallung order was completely different. These are now essentially the
same. So the channels on the left are the correct Dante channels for the
Beschalling; those in parentheses on the right are the SAD-P Dante input
channels, for info only, i.e. not to be used by ICEM.
